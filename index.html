					<p>Aham had one daughter by age 19, a second daughter by 21, and a vasectomy by 22.</p>
					<p>At 25, when the story begins, Aham is a recently divorced single father who spends his days working a soul-deadening corporate job, and his nights blasting a trumpet at Seattle jazz joints. Aham also has to struggle with opinionated bankers and mother’s
						love of free haircuts from the ex to pull his life out of the ruins of the broken marriage. Aham is sad, Aham is lonely, Aham needs to find a new apartment.</p>

					<p>He meets Megan.</p>
					<p>Both desperately want to fall in love, but the harder they try, the more they become like ships passing in the night. Then the Nigerian father Aham never knew and always wanted to meet suddenly dies in faraway Africa. And just when he thinks things
						can’t get worse, just when he thinks he can’t hold it together anymore, he learns what it really means to fall apart.</p>
